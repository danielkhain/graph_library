# Graph Library

This is a C++ Graph Library that can be used to implement graph-based programs.
The library supports the creation of nodes, addition and deletion of edges, and can calculate the shortest path between two nodes and
the minimum spanning tree.

A short sample program is below, and a more detailed sample program is provided in the next section.
```
#include "Graph.h"

int main() {
    Graph g;

    g.setVerbose(true);

    g.addNode();
    g.addNode();
    g.addNode();

    g.addEdge(0, 1, 1);
    g.addEdge(1, 2, 7);

    g.shortestPath(0, 2);
    g.printCSV();

}
```
The short sample program can be executed with the following steps:
1. `make clean`
2. `make test`
3. `./test`

The program's output is as follows:

```
Adding node 0.
Adding node 1.
Adding node 2.
Adding edge from 0 to 1.
Adding edge from 1 to 0.
Adding edge from 1 to 2.
Adding edge from 2 to 1.
The shortest path from node 0 to 2 is 8.000000.

0.000000,1.000000,inf,
1.000000,0.000000,7.000000,
inf,7.000000,0.000000,
```


## Sample Program: Infections on a Network
The Graph Library can be used to model an infection spreading through a network.
### Running Instructions
1. `make clean`
2. `make infection`
3. `./infection`

### Description
This sample program creates a random graph with `numNodes` nodes.
A randomly selected node is then infected.
The infection spreads with a defined transmission coefficient and can only be spread to neighbors.
The program first iterates through the initially-infected node's neighbors, infecting them with `transmission_coefficient` probability.
Then, the same occurs to each newly infected node.
Finally, some statistics are printed out.

### Example
This program was run with 50 nodes and a transmission coefficient of 0.3.
The resulting infection graph can be seen below (visualization courtesy of https://graphonline.ru/en/).
The initially infected node is colored pink, and the resultant infected nodes are beige.
In this simulation, 8/50 nodes were infected.
The number of edges is 56.
The average degree of each node is 2.
